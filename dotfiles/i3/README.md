# I3 Configuration

i3 is a very highly customizatble desktop enviroment. I migrated from hypralnd to i3 because I could not work with wayland. I am planning to go to dwm after certain times however I will stick with i3 for now.
This desktop enviroment is for me to be able to use tiling window manager and this just works for me and more so that I love my setup. Note that anything I have is specifically of my own personal preference and therefore should be just taken as the only way of doing things.
